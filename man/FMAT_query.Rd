\title{Prepare a data.table of queries and variables for the FMAT.}
\usage{
FMAT_query(
  query = "Text with [MASK], optionally with {TARGET} and/or {ATTRIB}.",
  MASK = .(),
  TARGET = .(),
  ATTRIB = .(),
  unmask.id = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{Query text (should be a character string/vector
with at least one \code{[MASK]} token).
Multiple queries share the same set of
\code{MASK}, \code{TARGET}, and \code{ATTRIB}.
For multiple queries with different
\code{MASK}, \code{TARGET}, and/or \code{ATTRIB},
please use \code{\link{FMAT_query_bind}} to combine them.}

\item{MASK}{A named list of \code{[MASK]} target words.
Must be single words in the vocabulary of a certain masked language model.
Note that infrequent words may be not included in a model's vocabulary,
and in this case you may insert the words into the context by
specifying either \code{TARGET} or \code{ATTRIB}.}

\item{TARGET, ATTRIB}{A named list of Target/Attribute words or phrases.
If specified, then \code{query} must contain
\code{{TARGET}} and/or \code{{ATTRIB}} (in all uppercase and in braces)
to be replaced by the words/phrases.}

\item{unmask.id}{If there are multiple \code{[MASK]} in \code{query},
this argument will be used to determine which one is to be unmasked.
Defaults to the 1st \code{[MASK]}.}
}
\value{
A data.table of queries and variables.

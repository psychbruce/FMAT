Description:
    The Fill-Mask Association Test ('FMAT') is an integrative, versatile,
    and probability-based method that uses Masked Language Models
    ('BERT' <arXiv:1810.04805> and its related models available at
    'Hugging Face' <https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=fill-mask>)
    to measure conceptual associations (e.g., attitudes, biases, stereotypes)
    as propositional representations in natural language.
    'Python' and the 'transformers' module also need to be installed
    (see <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation>).

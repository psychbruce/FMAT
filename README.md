üò∑ The Fill-Mask Association Test (Êé©Á†ÅÂ°´Á©∫ËÅîÁ≥ªÊµãÈ™å).

The *Fill-Mask Association Test* (FMAT) is an integrative, versatile, and probability-based method using Masked Language Models ([BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)) to measure conceptual associations (e.g., attitudes, biases, stereotypes, social norms, cultural values) as *propositions* in natural language ([Bao, 2024, *JPSP*](https://doi.org/10.1037/pspa0000396)).

## Installation

To use the FMAT, the R package `FMAT` and two Python packages (`transformers` and `torch`) all need to be installed.

### (1) R Package

``` r
## Method 1: Install from CRAN
install.packages("FMAT")

## Method 2: Install from GitHub
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("psychbruce/FMAT", force=TRUE)
```

### (2) Python Environment and Packages

#### Step 1

Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) (a recommended package manager which automatically installs Python, Python IDEs like Spyder, and a large list of necessary [Python package dependencies](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/pkg-docs/)).

#### Step 2

Specify the Python interpreter in RStudio.

> RStudio ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Global/Project Options\
> ‚Üí Python ‚Üí Select ‚Üí **Conda Environments**\
> ‚Üí Choose **".../Anaconda3/python.exe"**

#### Step 3

Install the "[transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation)" and "[torch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)" Python packages.\
(Windows Command / Anaconda Prompt / RStudio Terminal)

```         
pip install transformers torch
```

See [Guidance for GPU Acceleration] if you have an NVIDIA GPU device on your PC and want to use GPU to accelerate the pipeline.

#### Alternative Approach

(Not suggested) Besides the pip/conda installation in the *Conda Environment*, you might instead create and use a *Virtual Environment* (see R code below with the `reticulate` package), but then you need to specify the Python interpreter as **"\~/.virtualenvs/r-reticulate/Scripts/python.exe"** in RStudio.

``` r
## DON'T RUN THIS UNLESS YOU PREFER VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
library(reticulate)
# install_python()
virtualenv_create()
virtualenv_install(packages=c("transformers", "torch"))
```

## Guidance for FMAT

### FMAT Step 1: Query Design

Design queries that conceptually represent the constructs you would measure (see [Bao, 2024, *JPSP*](https://doi.org/10.1037/pspa0000396) for how to design queries).

Use `FMAT_query()` and/or `FMAT_query_bind()` to prepare a `data.table` of queries.

### FMAT Step 2: Model Loading

Use `BERT_download()` and `FMAT_load()` to (down)load BERT models. Model files are saved to your local folder "%USERPROFILE%/.cache/huggingface". A full list of BERT-family models are available at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=fill-mask&library=transformers).

### FMAT Step 3: Model Processing

Use `FMAT_run()` to get raw data (probability estimates) for further analysis.

Several steps of pre-processing have been included in the function for easier use (see `FMAT_run()` for details).

-   For BERT variants using `<mask>` rather than `[MASK]` as the mask token, the input query will be *automatically* modified so that users can always use `[MASK]` in query design.
-   For some BERT variants, special prefix characters such as `\u0120` and `\u2581` will be *automatically* added to match the whole words (rather than subwords) for `[MASK]`.

### BERT Models

The reliability and validity of the following 12 representative BERT models have been established in my research articles, but future work is needed to examine the performance of other models.

### Notes

-   Improvements are ongoing, especially for adaptation to more diverse (less popular) BERT models.
-   If you find bugs or have problems using the functions, please report them at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/psychbruce/FMAT/issues) or send me an email.

## Guidance for GPU Acceleration

### NVIDIA GPU Acceleration

By default, the `FMAT` package uses CPU to enable the functionality for all users. But for advanced users who want to accelerate the pipeline with GPU, the `FMAT_load()` function now supports using a GPU device, which may perform **3x faster** than CPU.

### Step 1

Ensure that you have an NVIDIA GPU device (e.g., GeForce RTX Series) and an NVIDIA GPU driver installed on your system.

### Step 2

Install PyTorch (Python `torch` package) with CUDA support (<https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>).

-   CUDA is only available on Windows and Linux, but not on MacOS.
-   If you have installed a version of `torch` without CUDA support, please first uninstall it (command: `pip uninstall torch`) and then install the suggested one.
-   You may also install the corresponding version of CUDA Toolkit (e.g., for the `torch` version supporting CUDA 12.1, the same version of [CUDA Toolkit 12.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-1-0-download-archive) may also be installed).

Example code for installing PyTorch with CUDA support:\
(Windows Command / Anaconda Prompt / RStudio Terminal)

```         
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

### Step 3

Check with the `FMAT` package.

``` r
library(FMAT)
# BERT_download("bert-base-uncased")
model = FMAT_load("bert-base-uncased", gpu=TRUE)
```

```

## Related Packages

While the FMAT is an innovative method for the *computational intelligent* analysis of psychology and society, you may also seek for an integrative toolbox for other text-analytic methods. Another R package I developed---[PsychWordVec](https://psychbruce.github.io/PsychWordVec/)---is useful and user-friendly for word embedding analysis (e.g., the Word Embedding Association Test, WEAT). Please refer to its documentation and feel free to use it.
